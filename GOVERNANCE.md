## Express Working Group Governance

### Collaborators

The expressjs/express GitHub repository is maintained by the Express TC and 
additional Collaborators who are added by the TC on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These individuals are
identified by the TC and their addition as Collaborators is discussed during
the weekly TC meeting.

Individuals who have made significant contributions and who wish to be
considered for commit-access may create an issue or contact a TC member
directly. It is not necessary to wait for a TC member to nominate the
individual.

Modifications of the contents of the expressjs/express repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See _Consensus Seeking Process_ below for further detail
on the consensus model used for governance.

Collaborators may opt to escalate discussion about significant or
controversial modifications to the TC as a whole by assigning the
`express-agenda` tag to a pull request or issue. The TC should serve as the
final arbiter where required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project [README.md][].

### TC Membership

TC seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the TC.
However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TC
membership beyond these rules.

The TC may add additional members to the TC by consensus. If there are
any objections to adding any individual member, an attempt should be
made to resolve those objections following the TC's Consensus Seeking
Process.

A TC member may be removed from the TC by voluntary resignation, or by
consensus of all other TC members.

Changes to TC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item (see "TC Meetings" below).

If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full
TC is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal
is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure
that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions.  If a TC member is unable to attend a meeting
where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent
is assumed.

If the TC membership consists of more than 3 active participants, no more than
1/3 of the TC members may be affiliated with the same employer.  If removal or
resignation of a TC member, or a change of employment by a TC member, creates a
situation where more than 1/3 of the TC membership shares an employer, then the
situation must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or
more TC members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

### TC Meetings

The TC meets bi-weekly using Google Hangouts on Air or similar tool that allows
public viewing or participation. A designated moderator approved by the TC runs
the meeting. A recording of each meeting should be published to either YouTube
or similar service and all meeting minutes should be posted to the
expressjs/express GitHub repository.

Items are added to the TC agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, TC membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
TC member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the `express-agenda` tag to the issue.

Prior to each TC meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with
members of the TC. TC members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the TC
cannot veto or remove items.

The TC may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to
participate in a non-voting capacity.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

### Consensus Seeking Process

The TC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a TC member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the TC
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.

Note that changes to TC membership require consensus. If there are any
objections to adding or removing individual members, an effort must be
made to resolve those objections. If consensus cannot be reached, a
vote may be called following the process above.
