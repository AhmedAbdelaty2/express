Rewritten the examples with Tas. The code structure is clearer, which helps user better understand Express and Node.js and master modular development in Express and Node.js.

Tas makes the code structure clear, turning async code to sync, reducing the levels, avoiding callback hell / pyramid, is better than Promise. [See details](https://github.com/tasjs/tas)

Some examples use Fac to create objects. Fac simplifies JavaScript programming. With Fac, we no longer need to simulate classes and inheritance, just use object and extending. [See details](https://github.com/tasjs/fac)


## How to Use

Install Tas and Fac first:

```bash
$ npm install tas fac --save-dev
```

Enjoy!
